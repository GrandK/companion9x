= Building companion9X on Visual Studio for Windows =

Starting with version 0.20, companion9x is compiled under Visual C++ Express 2010

= Prerequisites =

You will need ...
 * [http://msdn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/express/aa975050.aspx Visual C++ 2010 Express] 
 * [http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/ Qt source zip] (v4.7.4)
 * [http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/download.cgi Xerces vc10 version]
 * [http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/xsd/3.3/windows/i686/xsd-3.3.0-i686-windows.zip xsd]
 * [http://mir2.ovh.net/ftp.apache.org/dist//xerces/c/3/binaries/xerces-c-3.1.1-x86-windows-vc-10.0.zip xerces]

= Random notes for Cam before I forget them =

I have put the pthread directory under C:\Programs. Could be better somewhere else? Also I have put the two files of inttypes inside C:\Programs\pthreads\pthreads.2 (yes, I am lazy, I know)

And (horrible) I put the 2 dlls for pthreads and xerces inside my companion9x/vsbuild directory (I have one source dir and 3 build dirs: msysbuild, vsbuild and lbuild for linux)

The command for CMake (inside the Visual Studio 2010 console): 
cmake ../src -G "Visual Studio 10"
