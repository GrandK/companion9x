= Building companion9x =

We're ready to grab the source files and build companion9x itself.

== Check out the c9x source ==

See the [http://code.google.com/p/companion9x/source/checkout project's Source page], as provided by Googlecode.

{{{
svn checkout http://companion9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk companion9x
}}}

== Prepare a Makefile using CMake ==

{{{
cd companion9x/src

cmake .
}}}

Finally, we're ready to compile ...

{{{
make clean && make
}}}

When the build process completes (with no show-stopping errors!) you will end up with a binary named `companion9x`.

You should now be able to run companion9x from your terminal, like so ...
{{{
./companion9x
}}}
