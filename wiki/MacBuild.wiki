#summary Building companion9x for the Mac
 
= Building C'9X for OS X =

Brief notes only until I figure out how it all works -- gruvin.

= Prerequisites =

You will need ...
 * [http://developer.apple.com/xcode/index.php Xcode 4] ( Apple Developer Tools)
 * [http://qt.nokia.com/ Qt] (Mac version, 4.x)
 * [http://www.cmake.org cmake]

== Installing Xcode ==

Xcode 4 is a massive (4GB) download. I believe it's free for OS X development, as opposed to iOS. _Somebody check me on this? I'm a paid up member, so not sure._

If you're doing any source compiling or code development on your Mac, then you already have Xcode. If not, you can get started by registering at the [http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/index.action Apple Developer] site.
 
== Installing Qt ==

I used [http://www.macports.org/ MacPorts] ...

{{{
sudo port install qt4-mac +framework
}}}

Frameworks is needed so that frameworks are available to bundle with our final C'9X application bundle.

The build take quite a while, so don't bother sitting around waiting for it!

== Installing CMAKE ==

MacPorts to the rescue again ...
{{{
sudo port install cmake
}}}
