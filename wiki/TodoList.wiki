#summary TODO list

= General =

  * Display somewhere the current firmware chosen, so that it is always visible
  * Current model displayed in bold in the MDI child windows
  * Better look & feel for the simu layout. These big buttons are not so beautiful!
  * Models configuration print
  * Gruvin9x-stable simulation (should be the default)
  * Try to catch exceptions from external firmwares and display them as errors (rather than exiting with a SEGFAULT + core dumped)
  * Design a new dialog box with a simple progress bar, based on avrdude output interpretation. With a details hide / show button which shows what we have today


= Import / export =
  * One model data import / export
  * Make our own .c9x files based on an xml formalism defined in the xsd
  * Er9x export (one TODO remaining) / simulation
  * Th9x import / export / simulation
