#summary TODO list

= General =
  * ~~Display somewhere the current firmware chosen, so that it is always visible~~
  * ~~Display the available size on the EEPROM~~
  * ~~Current model displayed in bold in the MDI child windows~~
  * Better look & feel for the simu layout. These big buttons are not so beautiful!
  * ~~Models configuration print~~
  * ~~Curves printed as graphics~~
  * ~~Gruvin9x-stable simulation~~
  * ~~Try to catch exceptions from external firmwares and display them as errors (rather than exiting with a SEGFAULT + core dumped)~~
  * Design a new dialog box with a simple progress bar, based on avrdude output interpretation. With a details hide / show button which shows what we have today
  * ~~Recent documents easier to access~~
  * ~~Implement a correct handling of Tx modes so that it's possible to change the mode without messing everything (same as g9x issue 63)~~
  * Checking updates and download of selected firmware.
  * ~~Add an entry in the contextual menu to change the current model~~
  * ~~Change the icon which comes from eePe (a graphist is welcome!!)~~
  * Add a what's new information to be displayed while prompting for updates
  * ~~Splash window should be visible at least 2-3 seconds!~~
  * ~~Phase names visible on simulation~~

= Ideas from eePe =
  * Diff feature to compare two models
  * Solid bars for simulators instead of standard sliders (perhaps only css)

= Import / export =
  * One model data import / export
  * Make our own .c9x files based on an xml formalism defined in the xsd
  * Er9x export (one TODO remaining) / simulation
  * Th9x import / export / simulation

= Help / translations =
  * All tooltips. A lot of work here!
  * Translations in all languages. Perhaps propose something really simple and intuitive, using Google Documents

= Multi platforms =
  * Mac packaging
  * Debian / Ubuntu packaging
  * RedHat / Suse packaging
