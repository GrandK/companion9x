=How to install on Mac=

=== Prerequisites ===

You will need ....

AVRDude 
I used [http://sourceforge.net/projects/osxavr/ OSX-AVR] and installed using the OSX-AVR-JAN07.mpkg
There are other options out there, [http://www.google.com Google] is your friend. 
I used OSX-AVR because it's easy.


== Installing ==

Download the current .dmg from the downloads area.

Open the .dmg and just run the installer. Companion9x is placed in Applications folder

You have to set the location of AVRDude under Burn>Configure
If you used OSX-AVR to install AVRDude it wil be 

  /usr/local/bin/avrdude

Thats it have fun
